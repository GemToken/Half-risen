# Half-risen
This project is a submission to Game Off 2019 hosted by Github on itch.io.

These directories contain the C# code that runs all of the game mechanics, as well as Assets created such as 3D models, textures, animations, etc.

As this game is open source, feel free to use and/or build upon what is already created!

If you want to play the game, you can find the compiled version at: https://vacxela.itch.io/half-risen
